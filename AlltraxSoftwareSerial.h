	Library for interfacing with an Alltrax AXE/DCX motor Controller.
	NOTE: an RS232 converter is necessary!
	It may work for other Alltrax series motor controllers, however
	only the AXE series has been tested. Based on work by Jennifer Holt
	(http://jennwork.homelinux.net/drupal6/node/26) and Alltrax
	(http://www.mail-archive.com/listserv@electricmotorcycles.net/msg01779.html)
